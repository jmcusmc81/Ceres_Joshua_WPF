//I have worked as an Aviation and Production Electronics and Instrumentation Technician for most my adult career. I use a lot of Algebra Ohm's Law and Boolean's Law.
//These Law's and algebraic formulas help me in my job daily.

//Problem: I have a 480V Motor with 100 Amps Current(I). I need to figure out the Resistance(R) and the Power(W).
//Units of measurement are Volts = Voltage, Amps = Current, Ohms = Resistance, Watts = Power.

var voltage= 480;
var amps=100;
var amps=100;
var resistance=voltage/amps + " Ohms";
console.log(resistance);
var power=voltage*amps + " Watts";
console.log(power);
