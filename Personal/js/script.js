//I chose diapers because I go through this everyday and can relate to this the most. Its time consuming and costs a lot of money.

var diapers = prompt("How many diapers do you change per day? \nPlease enter the quantity");
console.log(diapers);
var daysYear=365; //Days in a year
console.log(daysYear);
var quantity =daysYear * diapers; //calculates with that info
console.log(quantity);
var result= "The amount of diapers you will need is " + quantity + " per year";
alert(result);
console.log(result);

//Prompt makes user enter how many diapers per day he/she uses. Then my formula takes that and times it by how many days are in a calendar year.
//Then it sends the result back in the form of an alert so the user knows what he/she needs. This is a bare minimun based off how many they change per day.
//There can always be extra because of mishaps with a baby.
