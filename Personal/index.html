<p><b>Personal - How many Diapers do you need?</b></p>
<br/>
<p>I am going to give you the tools to determine how many diapers(minimum) you will need per year. <b>This does not include mishaps.</b></p>
<p>This personal part of the assignment is a huge part of m life. I already made a flowchart on feeding a baby. Now I am showing how much diapers you can go through in a years time</p>
<p>Diapers are not cheap and this is a huge cost in anyone's life.</p>
