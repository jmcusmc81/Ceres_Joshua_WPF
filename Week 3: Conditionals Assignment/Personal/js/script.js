//I am going to attempt to predict my date night with my wife for Sunday for out Anniversary.
//We tend to eat and get tired afterwards. We always have intentions to go dancing and do something fun after we eat, but it seldom happens.
//So I am going to start by using a sliding scale of 1-10 for energy level.
//My Given energy level is 10 before we go to eat for both of us. (Whatever she is feeling I feel the same way.)

var energyLevel = 10; //Given
var dancing = (enegryLevel > 5); //Energy level needs to be higher then 5 for our night out after dinner.
