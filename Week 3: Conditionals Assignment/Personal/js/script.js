//Week 3 Graded Assignment:Conditionals

//I am going to attempt to predict my date night with my wife for Sunday for out Anniversary.
//We tend to eat and get tired afterwards. We always have intentions to go dancing and do something fun after we eat, but it seldom happens.
//So I am going to start by using a sliding scale of 1-10 for energy level.
//My Given energy level is 10 before we go to eat for both of us. (Whatever she is feeling I feel the same way.)
/*
var energyLevel = 5; //Given
var dancing = (energyLevel > 5); //Energy level needs to be higher then 5 for a night out after dinner.

if(dancing){
    console.log("Lets have some fun!"); //After a nice dinner its nice to go dancing with the wife.
}else{
    console.log("Lets go for a walk");//Sometimes after a nice dinner we are to tired and just want to go for a walk.
}
    */
//Ternary
//Going to change the conditional statement to ternary operators.
