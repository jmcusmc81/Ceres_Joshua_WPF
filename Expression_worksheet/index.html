<p><b> Bold Dog Years - Problem 1</b><p/>
Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.
Givens:<br>
<br>
Sparky’s age.<br>
Result Variable:<br>
<br>
Sparky’s age in dog years.<br>
Result to Print:<br>
<br>
“Sparky is X human years old which is X in dog years.<br>
<br>

<p><b>Slice of Pie part 1</b><p/>

A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party.  (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the person dividing the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)
Given:<br>
<br>
Number of slices per pizza<br>
Number of people at the party<br>
Number of pizzas ordered.<br>
Result Variables:<br>
<br>
Number of slices per person. (Can be a decimal or floating point).<br>
Result to Print:<br>
<br>
“Each person ate X slices of pizza at the party.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Slice of Pie part II</b><p/>
<br>
At the pizza party Sparky, the host’s dog is excited, because he gets the leftover pizza after the slices have been divided up evenly among the guests. Assume guests get whole slices, how many whole slices will Sparky feast on?<br>
<br>
Example data set: 10 people, 4 pizzas and 8 slices per pizza will mean each person eats 3 slices and Sparky gets 2 slices. (Note that this is an example, your code should work and give me the accurate results no matter what numbers I put in for those given variables.)<br>
Given:<br>
<br>
Don’t make new given variables/constants for this. Instead use the givens you set up for Slice of Pie I.<br>
Result Variables:<br>
<br>
Number of slices Sparky gets to eat.<br>
Result to Print:<br>
<br>
“Sparky got X slices of pizza.”<br>
