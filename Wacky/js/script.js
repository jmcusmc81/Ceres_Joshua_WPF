//This is my Wacky project. I am going to assign number values to incidents that make my wife angry. This is going to be a scale of 1-10. Once she reaches 10 then she loses it.
//My wife is half filipino-half italian so she can do a 180 degree turn at any time and just unleash hell in the house. I sweat I think she is bi-polar but she wont get check out.
//The goal of this is to track how many times my wife goes full on rage mode.
var a = 5; //Messy House
var b = 4; //Kids crying
var c = 3.5; //Repeats herself. This usually takes three times of her repeating herself before she loses it.
var d = 3; //Kids do not do chores or argue
var e = 2.5; //I forget to do something that she asked me to do. I am slowly wearing her out on this issue.
//Once this adds up to 10 watch out!!
console.log(rage);
var rageExplosion = 10; //We have reached 10 now run for cover!
//First hour of the day 7:00 - 8:00 A.M.
var firstHour = d;
//Second hour 8:00 - 9:00 A.M.
var secondHour = d + c + b + " Rage at Maximum!";// Rage at Maximum and well on our way to a Nuclear Meltdown.
console.log(secondHour);
alert(secondHour);
